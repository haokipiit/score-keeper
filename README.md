About Score Keeper:
It is a ping pong game score keeper. If a player gets a point it is increased using the button provided for player1 and same for player2.
The maximum points can be set before the game (for this small project, the maximum points can range from 3 to 11).
So whoever gets the maximum point first will win the game.

Materials used:
1. HTML
